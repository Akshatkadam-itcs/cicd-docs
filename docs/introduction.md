# Introduction to CI/CD

In today's fast pace developement world, delivering code quickly and efficiently is crucial. Continous Integration (CI) and Continous Deployment (CD) are moder DevOps concepts that automates the entire software release process - from commits to product deployemnts.


## ðŸ’¡ What is CI/CD?

CI & CD are the DevOps practices that automates between writing and deploying the code. It helps teams to detect issues early, reduce manual work, and release software faster.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently merge code into a shared branch, and automated builds and tests run immediately.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Code is automatically prepared for a production release after passing all tests.
- **Continuous Deployment (also CD):** Every change that passes tests is deployed to production automatically.


## Why CI/CD?

- Faster Delivery: Automation cuts down on delays while building, testing, and deploying it.
- Fewer Bugs: Issues in the code are caught in the early stages of Software Development Lifecycle.
- Consistency: Repetable workflows reduces human error.
- Better testing: Every code changes are passed through pipelines.


## Tools Commonly Used

- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- CI/CD Platforms: GitLab, GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes and Terrafrom.


## Summary

CI/CD platforms have changed the way of how teams build a software. By integrating the automation, team are now able to write code faster, catch errors in the early stages, commits changes and deploy code automatically so that th risk of human errors is reduced.
